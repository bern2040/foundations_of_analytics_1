In this assignment, we focused on probability distributions, including both discrete and continuous types. We explored the binomial distribution, learning about its properties and applications in scenarios like quality control. We also studied the normal distribution, understanding its relevance in modeling natural phenomena. The exercises involved calculating probabilities and expected values, emphasizing the mathematical foundations of these distributions. We also practiced fitting data to these distributions and estimating their parameters.
